CSS Recommendations
-------------------------------

All visual styling should normally be done in CSS using modular files corresponding to subviews and elements and built using PostCSS, SASS, or some other build tool.

#### Layout and Sizes

The layouts and sizing should all be related to and scoped under views, which is why the styles plugin is recommended.
